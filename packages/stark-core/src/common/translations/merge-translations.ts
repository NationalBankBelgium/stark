/**
 * This function can be used by Stark modules to merge their translations into existing translations,
 * without losing any existing translations.
 *
 * There are three 'levels' that can provide translations:
 *   1. Common: for the Stark framework, they are stored in the `translations` folder in the current folder.
 *   2. Module: each module contains it's own translations, to make Stark fully modular.
 *   3. App: the translations provided by the client application that implements the Stark framework.
 *
 * These levels have a hierarchy, where the common translations have to lowest priority and the translations
 * of the client application have the highest priority. This means that if one or more levels have a
 * translation with the same key, the translation with the highest priority 'wins'.
 *
 * Functionality:
 * First the existing translations are stored in a variable `translations`.
 * The function then iterates over the `args` parameters.
 * For each language, the following steps are processed:
 *   1. The translateService is cleaned (shouldMerge = `false`)
 *   2. The 'common' translations are added in the translateService
 *   3. The 'module' translations are added in the translateService, replacing any existing translations
 *   4. The 'stored' translations are added in the translateService, replacing any existing translations
 *
 * @param translateService - A reference to the translateService instance
 * @param localesToMerge - A list of StarkLocales that contain the translations for a specific language
 *
 * @example:
 *   mergeTranslations(this.translateService, english, french, dutch);
