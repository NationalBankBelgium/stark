MockStarkRBACAuthorizationService can be imported as follows:\nimport { MockStarkRBACAuthorizationService } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-rbac/testing\";Since the mock class implements the base interface of the service it mocks, you just need to provide the mock in your TestingModule:\nTestBed.configureTestingModule({\n    imports: [...],\n    declarations: [...],\n    providers: [\n        ...\n        { provide: STARK_RBAC_AUTHORIZATION_SERVICE, useValue: new MockStarkRBACAuthorizationService() },\n        ...\n    ]\n});Then you can just inject the Stark service via the TestBed using its corresponding InjectionToken:\n// this will inject the instantiated mock class\nmockRBACAuthorizationService = TetBed.get(STARK_RBAC_AUTHORIZATION_SERVICE);In fact, every method of the base interface is simply mocked\nwith a Jasmine Spy which can then be used in the unit tests to:\n\nreturn custom values\noverride a method with a custom function\nasserting that they are actually called\ndo any other operation than can be performed with an Spy.\n\nFor example:\n// returning custom value\nmockRBACAuthorizationService.hasRole.and.returnValue(true);\n\n// overriding a method with a custom function\nmockRBACAuthorizationService.hasRole.and.callFake((someRole) => {\n  // some custom logic to return a specific value\n});\n\n// asserting that a method was indeed called\nexpect(mockRBACAuthorizationService.hasAnyRole).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);\nexpect(mockRBACAuthorizationService.hasAnyRole).toHaveBeenCalledWith(someRoles);\n    \n\n    \n        import {
