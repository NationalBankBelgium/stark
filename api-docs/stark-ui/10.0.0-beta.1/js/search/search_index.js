properties/methods of the host component where this directive is used will not be accessible.\nIn case you want to access any variable or method of your component where you include this directive from the callback function,\nyou should bind the component's \"this\" context to the callback function passed to the directive with the \"bind()\" method.\nFor example:\n * \n *Then in your component your callback could be defined like this:\n * public yourCallbackFn(paramValue: string): void {\n *      this.someProperty; // is the value of the component's \"someProperty\" due to the \".bind(this)\" in the callback passed to the directive, otherwise it would be \"undefined\"!\n *      paramValue; // is \"someValue\" since it was a literal param passed via the [starkOnEnterKeyParams] input\n * }\n
