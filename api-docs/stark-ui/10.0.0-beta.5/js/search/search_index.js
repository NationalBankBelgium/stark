the callback passed to the directive, otherwise it would be \"undefined\"!\n *      paramValue; // is \"someValue\" since it was a literal param passed via the [starkOnEnterKeyParams] input\n * }\n

to the StarkProgressIndicatorService and creates an instance of the StarkProgressIndicatorComponent which is the one that actually displays the progress indicator (e.g., spinner).\nFrom then on you can control the state/visibility of the progress indicator programmatically by using the StarkProgressIndicatorService:\n * // the service should be injected in your component\n * @Inject(STARK_PROGRESS_INDICATOR_SERVICE) private progressService: StarkProgressIndicatorService\n *\n * // then you can call the method to show the progress indicator\n * this.progressService.show(this.progressIndicatorConfig.topic);\n * // or to hide it\n * this.progressService.hide(this.progressIndicatorConfig.topic);\n *\n            \n\n            \n

Directive to transform the input value of an input or textarea. It sits between the native element and the ngControl (ngModel/formControl) so observers are triggered only once.\nThis directive will not affect changes applied trough code, only user input will be transformed. This means i.a. initial values are not transformed.\nIt is possible to pass 'uppercase', 'lowercase' or a custom function to transform the value. This directive works if the input is controlled or not.\n\n            \n\n            \n                Implements\n            \n            \n                        ControlValueAccessor\n
