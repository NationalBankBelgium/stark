MockStarkAppSidebarService can be imported as follows:\nimport { MockStarkAppSidebarService } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui/testing\";Since the mock class implements the base interface of the service it mocks, you just need to provide the mock in your TestingModule:\nTestBed.configureTestingModule({\n    imports: [...],\n    declarations: [...],\n    providers: [\n        ...\n        { provide: STARK_APP_SIDEBAR_SERVICE, useValue: new MockStarkAppSidebarService() },\n        ...\n    ]\n});Then you can just inject the Stark service via the TestBed using its corresponding InjectionToken:\n// this will inject the instantiated mock class\nmockStarkAppSidebarService = TestBed.inject(STARK_APP_SIDEBAR_SERVICE);In fact, every method of the base interface is simply mocked\nwith a Jasmine Spy which can then be used in the unit tests to:\n\nreturn custom values\noverride a method with a custom function\nasserting that they are actually called\ndo any other operation than can be performed with an Spy.\n\nFor example:\n// reading a value\nconst sidebarOpen$ = mockStarkAppSidebarService.openSidebar$;\n\n// overriding a method with a custom function\nmockStarkAppSidebarService.openMenu.and.callFake(() => {\n  // some custom logic\n});\n\n// asserting that a method was indeed called\nexpect(mockStarkAppSidebarService.close).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);\n    \n\n    \n        import { StarkAppSidebarOpenEvent, StarkAppSidebarService } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui\";\nimport { Subject } from \"rxjs\";\nimport Spy = jasmine.Spy;\nimport SpyObj = jasmine.SpyObj;\nimport createSpy = jasmine.createSpy;\n\n/**\n * Mock class of the

\"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui/testing\";Since the mock class implements the base interface of the service it mocks, you just need to provide the mock in your TestingModule:\nTestBed.configureTestingModule({\n    imports: [...],\n    declarations: [...],\n    providers: [\n        ...\n        { provide: STARK_MESSAGE_PANE_SERVICE, useValue: new MockStarkMessagePaneService() },\n        ...\n    ]\n});Then you can just inject the Stark service via the TestBed using its corresponding InjectionToken:\n// this will inject the instantiated mock class\nmockStarkMessagePaneService = TestBed.inject(STARK_MESSAGE_PANE_SERVICE);In fact, every method of the base interface is simply mocked\nwith a Jasmine Spy which can then be used in the unit tests to:\n\nreturn custom values\noverride a method with a custom function\nasserting that they are actually called\ndo any other operation than can be performed with an Spy.\n\nFor example:\n// reading a value\nconst shouldBeClearedOnNavigation = mockStarkMessagePaneService.clearOnNavigation;\n\n// returning custom value\nmockStarkMessagePaneService.getAll.and.returnValue(someCustomObservable);\n\n// overriding a method with a custom function\nmockStarkMessagePaneService.add.and.callFake((messages: StarkMessage[]) => {\n  // some custom logic to add the messages\n});\n\n// asserting that a method was indeed called\nexpect(mockStarkMessagePaneService.add).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);\n    \n\n    \n        import { StarkMessagePaneService } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui\";\nimport Spy = jasmine.Spy;\nimport SpyObj = jasmine.SpyObj;\nimport createSpy = jasmine.createSpy;\n\n/**\n * Mock

class MockStarkProgressIndicatorService can be imported as follows:\nimport { MockStarkProgressIndicatorService } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui/testing\";Since the mock class implements the base interface of the service it mocks, you just need to provide the mock in your TestingModule:\nTestBed.configureTestingModule({\n    imports: [...],\n    declarations: [...],\n    providers: [\n        ...\n        { provide: STARK_PROGRESS_INDICATOR_SERVICE, useValue: new MockStarkProgressIndicatorService() },\n        ...\n    ]\n});Then you can just inject the Stark service via the TestBed using its corresponding InjectionToken:\n// this will inject the instantiated mock class\nmockStarkProgressIndicatorService = TestBed.inject(STARK_PROGRESS_INDICATOR_SERVICE);In fact, every method of the base interface is simply mocked\nwith a Jasmine Spy which can then be used in the unit tests to:\n\nreturn custom values\noverride a method with a custom function\nasserting that they are actually called\ndo any other operation than can be performed with an Spy.\n\nFor example:\n// returning custom value\nmockStarkProgressIndicatorService.isVisible.and.returnValue(someCustomObservable);\n\n// overriding a method with a custom function\nmockStarkProgressIndicatorService.show.and.callFake((topic: string) => {\n  // some custom logic\n});\n\n// asserting that a method was indeed called\nexpect(mockStarkProgressIndicatorService.show).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);\n    \n\n    \n        import { StarkProgressIndicatorService } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui\";\nimport Spy =

easy to run the application with different roles.\n\n    \n\n\n    \n        Implements\n    \n    \n                    OnInit\n    \n\n\n\n    Metadata\n    \n        \n\n            \n

search.\nDue to a limitation in browser API, other input types, such as email or number, cannot be supported.\nDisabling the mask\nPassing an undefined value as config to the directive will disable the mask.\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n            \n                Extends\n            \n            \n                    MaskedInputDirective\n            \n\n            \n

This directive must be used as attribute on a DOM element and the config provided should be a StarkProgressIndicatorConfig object:\n\n\nOnce the directive is initialized, it registers itself to the StarkProgressIndicatorService and creates an instance of the StarkProgressIndicatorComponent which is the one that actually displays the progress indicator (e.g., spinner).\nFrom then on you can control the state/visibility of the progress indicator programmatically by using the StarkProgressIndicatorService:\n// the service should be injected in your component\n@Inject(STARK_PROGRESS_INDICATOR_SERVICE) private progressService: StarkProgressIndicatorService;\n\n// then you can call the method to show the progress indicator\nthis.progressService.show(this.progressIndicatorConfig.topic);\n// or to hide it\nthis.progressService.hide(this.progressIndicatorConfig.topic);\n            \n\n\n            \n

Directive to transform the input value of an input or textarea. It sits between the native element and the ngControl (ngModel/formControl) so observers are triggered only once.\nThis directive will not affect changes applied trough code, only user input will be transformed. This means i.a. initial values are not transformed.\nIt is possible to pass 'uppercase', 'lowercase' or a custom function to transform the value. This directive works if the input is controlled or not.\n\n// OR\n\n// OR\n\n            \n\n\n            \n                Implements\n            \n            \n

\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting started\nThe recommended way to get started with Stark is to download the starter and run npm install.\nStyling\nThe starter comes with most things preconfigured meaning that all SCSS files needed for Stark-UI are imported by default via ~@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui/assets/stark-ui-bundle:\n/*\nIMPORTANT: Stark styles are provided as SCSS styles so they should be imported in a SCSS file!\n*/\n@import \"theme\";\n@import \"~@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui/assets/stark-ui-bundle\";\n/* App */\n@import \"../app/app.component\";You can also pick and choose which parts of the Stark-UI styling/theming you want to use.\nSimply remove @import \"~@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui/assets/stark-ui-bundle\"; from src/styles/styles.scss and import only the desired files.\nIMPORTANT: Import base.scss and base-theme.scss since these provide you with a clean basis and some basics for styling/theming your app.\n/*\nIMPORTANT: Stark-UI styles are provided as SCSS styles so they should be imported in a SCSS file!\n*/\n@import \"theme\";\n/* Stark-UI styles */\n@import \"~@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui/assets/styles/base\";\n@import \"~@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui/assets/theming/base-theme\";\n/* Stark-UI component styles */\n@import \"~@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui/src/modules/app-logo/components/app-logo-theme\";\n@import \"~@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui/src/modules/app-logo/components/app-logo.component\";\n/* App */\n@import \"../app/app.component\";Or you can replace the Stark-UI styling with your own:\n/*\nIMPORTANT: Stark-UI styles are provided as SCSS styles so they should be imported in a SCSS file!\n*/\n@import \"theme\";\n/* Stark-UI styles */\n@import \"~@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui/assets/styles/base\";\n@import \"~@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui/assets/theming/base-theme\";\n/* Stark-UI component styles */\n@import \"~@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui/src/modules/app-logo/components/app-logo-theme\";\n/* Custom Stark-UI component styles */\n@import \"your-custom-stark-ui-styles/app-logo.component\";\n/* App */\n@import \"../app/app.component\";Typings\nStark-UI also provides some typings for some libraries that are used internally by some components/directives. This are located under the typings folder.\nFor this reason, you must add these typings to the typeRoots in the tsconfig.json of your app so that Angular compiler can build your application correctly:\n{\n  ...\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n     ...\n    \"typeRoots\": [\n      \"./node_modules/@types\",\n      \"./node_modules/@nationalbankbelgium/stark-build/typings\",\n      \"./node_modules/@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui/typings\"  // typings folder from Stark-UI\n    ],\n    ...\n  },\n  ...\n}IMPORTANT: This should always be done even if you don't use such types yourself. As mentioned above, this is used by Stark-UI internally.\nAssets\nMaterial Icons\nThe different features provided by Stark-UI (components and directives) follow the Material Design specs as much as possible. This is the reason why all the components\nare implemented with Angular Material and the icons used are also from the Material Design specs.\nIn this case, the icons used in Stark-UI are provided by MaterialDesign-Angular-Material which is an SVG icon set specially\nbundled for Angular Material. You can see the different icons that are available in this icon set at https://materialdesignicons.com/.\nTherefore you must add this SVG icon set in your angular.json so that it is copied to your application assets folder and the Stark-UI components can be rendered correctly:\n\"projects\": {\n    ...\n    \"your-app\": {\n        ...\n        \"architect\": {\n            ...\n            \"build\": {\n                \"options\": {\n                    \"assets\": [\n                        {\n                            \"glob\": \"mdi.svg\",\n                            \"input\": \"node_modules/@mdi/angular-material\",\n                            \"output\": \"assets/material-icons\"\n                        },\n                        ...\n                    ],\n                    ...\n                },\n                ...\n            },\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n}IMPORTANT: This should be done always even if you don't use any of these icons yourself. As mentioned above, these are used by Stark-UI internally.\nComponent assets\nSome Stark-UI components use certain predefined assets (mainly images) which are provided under the assets folder of the package. Therefore in case you use such components than\nyou should include those assets in your angular.json so that they are copied to your application assets folder and the Stark-UI components can be rendered correctly:\n\"projects\": {\n    ...\n    \"your-app\": {\n        ...\n        \"architect\": {\n            ...\n            \"build\": {\n                \"options\": {\n                    \"assets\": [\n                        {\n                            \"glob\": \"**/*\",\n                            \"input\": \"node_modules/@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui/assets/\",\n                            \"output\": \"assets/stark-ui\"\n                        },\n                        ...\n                    ],\n                    ...\n                },\n                ...\n            },\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n}IMPORTANT: This should be done only in case the Stark-UI component(s) you use requires any of these assets. In case you want to copy just certain assets from Stark-UI,\nmake sure that you copy them following this structure in your application assets folder:\n|\n+---yourApp\n|   +---assets\n|   |   +---stark-ui  // assets from Stark-UI should be available at this location\n|   ...This will ensure that your application assets folder will contain only the assets that are actually used in your app.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/generic-search-component.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/generic-search-component.html","title":"additional-page - Generic Search component","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStark Generic Search component\n1. About\nThis component provides a generic way to handle search flow in your application.\nYou only need to provide this component with your custom search form via transclusion and the necessary methods to perform the search.\nFinally this component will return the results in an Observable that you can subscribe to.\n2. How to use it\n2.1. Create an entity for the search (optional)\nFor using the Generic Search component, you must have an entity that describes your object. For some reasons, the entity which describes the search form could be different than the object and in this case, it is necessary to create a different entity to describe this search object.\nThis HowTo presents the usage of the Generic Search component with the search entity. Obviously, if you don't need a specific entity for the search, you could just replace the \"Search entity\" by the entity of your object in the code of the controllers, reducers and services that follow.\n2.1.1. Create the entity for your object\nFor the following example, we need this entity:\nimport { StarkResource } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-core\";\nimport { autoserialize } from \"cerialize\";\n\nexport class MovieObject implements StarkResource {\n  @autoserialize\n  public uuid: string;\n\n  @autoserialize\n  public year: number;\n\n  @autoserialize\n  public hero: string;\n\n  @autoserialize\n  public title: string;\n}2.1.2. Create the search entity file\nUnder the src/app/modules//entities folder create the type-data-search.entity.ts file.\nThis entity contains all the fields that the search form will contain to find a specific element in the concerned collection.\nexport class MovieSearchCriteria {\n  public year?: string;\n  public hero?: string;\n  public title?: string;\n}2.2. Create a form component\nGenerate your form component in src/app/modules//components by using ng cli:\nng generate component src/app/modules/my_module/components/my_component-search-form2.2.1. Define your component\nThe component must only have one input binding, the object which describes the content of the form.\nAnd the component have the output binding \"workingCopyChanged\" to emit a new value of the search criteria when they change.\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Inject, Input, OnChanges, OnInit, Output, SimpleChanges } from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { StarkSearchFormComponent } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui\";\nimport { MovieSearchCriteria } from \"../entities\";\nimport { FormBuilder, FormGroup } from \"@angular/forms\";\nimport { DEMO_GENERIC_SERVICE, DemoGenericService } from \"../services\";\n\nconst _isEqual: Function = require(\"lodash/isEqual\");\n\n@Component({\n  selector: \"movie-search-form\",\n  templateUrl: \"./movie-search-form.component.html\"\n})\nexport class MovieSearchFormComponent implements OnInit, OnChanges, StarkSearchFormComponent {\n  @Input()\n  public searchCriteria: MovieSearchCriteria = {};\n\n  @Output()\n  public workingCopyChanged: EventEmitter = new EventEmitter();\n\n  public yearOptions: number[] = [];\n  public heroOptions: string[] = [];\n  public movieOptions: string[] = [];\n\n  public searchForm: FormGroup;\n\n  public constructor(\n    @Inject(DEMO_GENERIC_SERVICE) private genericService: DemoGenericService,\n    private formBuilder: FormBuilder\n  ) {}\n\n  public ngOnInit(): void {\n    this.searchForm = this.createSearchForm(this.searchCriteria);\n\n    this.searchForm.valueChanges.subscribe(() => {\n      const modifiedCriteria: MovieSearchCriteria = this.mapFormGroupToSearchCriteria(this.searchForm);\n      this.workingCopyChanged.emit(modifiedCriteria);\n    });\n\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  public ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges): void {\n    if (\n      changes[\"searchCriteria\"] &&\n      !changes[\"searchCriteria\"].isFirstChange() &&\n      !_isEqual(changes[\"searchCriteria\"].previousValue, this.searchCriteria)\n    ) {\n      this.resetSearchForm(this.searchCriteria);\n    }\n  }\n\n  public createSearchForm(searchCriteria: MovieSearchCriteria): FormGroup {\n    return this.formBuilder.group({\n      year: searchCriteria.year,\n      hero: searchCriteria.hero,\n      movie: searchCriteria.movie\n    });\n  }\n\n  public resetSearchForm(searchCriteria: MovieSearchCriteria): void {\n    // reset the form fields but don't emit a \"change\" event to statusChanges and valueChanges to avoid infinite loops!\n    this.searchForm.reset(\n      {\n        year: searchCriteria.year,\n        hero: searchCriteria.hero,\n        movie: searchCriteria.movie\n      },\n      { emitEvent: false }\n    );\n  }\n\n  public mapFormGroupToSearchCriteria(formGroup: FormGroup): MovieSearchCriteria {\n    // return formGroup.getRawValue();\n\n    return {\n      year: formGroup.controls[\"year\"].value,\n      hero: formGroup.controls[\"hero\"].value,\n      title: formGroup.controls[\"title\"].value\n    };\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * @ignore\n   */\n  public trackItemFn(item: string): string {\n    return item;\n  }\n}2.2.2. Define your template\n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      {{ option }}\n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      {{ option }}\n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      {{ option }}\n    \n  \n2.3. Create the search actions\n2.3.1. Create the following files\nUnder the src/app/modules//actions folder create the files movies-search.actions.ts and index.ts.\n2.3.2. Define the actions\nThe following actions should be defined to make your GenericSearch working perfectly.\nimport { createAction, props, union } from \"@ngrx/store\";\nimport { MovieSearchCriteria } from \"../entities\";\n\nexport const setCriteria = createAction(\"[MovieSearch] Set criteria\", props());\nexport const removeCriteria = createAction(\"[MovieSearch] Remove criteria\");\nexport const hasSearched = createAction(\"[MovieSearch] Has searched\");\nexport const hasSearchedReset = createAction(\"[MovieSearch] Has searched reset\");\n\n/**\n * @ignore\n */\nconst all = union({ setCriteria, removeCriteria, hasSearched, hasSearchedReset });\nexport type Types = typeof all;2.3.3 Export the actions in barrel file\nExport all the actions as follows in your barrel (index.ts):\nimport * as MovieSearchActions from \"./movies-search.actions\";\nexport { MovieSearchActions };\nObviously, you'll have to export everything from your actions.ts file in your barrel (index.ts).\n2.4. Create the search reducers\n2.4.1. Create the following files\nUnder the src/app/modules//reducers folder create the files movie-search.reducer.ts and index.ts.\n2.4.2. Define the search reducer\nThe reducer must contain the following options.\nDon't forget to rename every variable and function that contain \"movies\" with your used type.\nimport { StarkSearchState } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui\";\nimport { createReducer, on } from \"@ngrx/store\";\nimport { MovieSearchCriteria } from \"../entities/movies-search.entity\";\nimport { MovieSearchActions } from \"../actions\";\n\nconst INITIAL_STATE: Readonly> = {\n  criteria: new MovieSearchCriteria(),\n  hasBeenSearched: false\n};\n\nconst reducer = createReducer, MovieSearchActions.Types>(\n  INITIAL_STATE,\n  on(DemoGenericSearchActions.setCriteria, (state, action) => ({ ...state, criteria: action.criteria })),\n  on(DemoGenericSearchActions.removeCriteria, (state) => ({ ...state, criteria: INITIAL_STATE.criteria })),\n  on(DemoGenericSearchActions.hasSearched, (state) => ({ ...state, hasBeenSearched: true })),\n  on(DemoGenericSearchActions.hasSearchedReset, (state) => ({ ...state, hasBeenSearched: false }))\n);\n\nexport function movieSearchReducer(\n  state: Readonly> | undefined,\n  action: Readonly\n): Readonly> {\n  return reducer(state, action);\n}2.4.3. Define the search reducers index\nCopy the following snippet in your reducers/index.ts file.\nDon't forget to rename every variable and function that contain \"movies\" with your used type.\nimport { StarkSearchState } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui\";\nimport { ActionReducerMap, createSelector, MemoizedSelector, createFeatureSelector } from \"@ngrx/store\";\nimport { MovieSearchCriteria } from \"../entities\";\nimport { MovieSearchActions } from \"../actions\";\nimport { movieSearchReducer } from \"./movie-search.reducer\";\n\nexport interface MovieSearchState {\n  movieSearch: StarkSearchState;\n}\n\nexport const movieSearchReducers: ActionReducerMap = {\n  movieSearch: movieSearchReducer\n};\n\nexport const selectMovieSearch: MemoizedSelector> = createSelector(\n  createFeatureSelector(\"MovieSearch\"),\n  (state: MovieSearchState) => state.movieSearch\n);2.4.4. Declare the reducers\nIn your module file, add the following import to be able to use your reducers.\n// imports\n\nimport { StoreModule } from \"@ngrx/store\";\nimport { movieSearchReducers } from \"./reducers\";\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    // ...\n    StoreModule.forFeature(\"MovieSearch\", movieSearchReducers)\n  ]\n})\nexport class MyModule {}2.5. Create the search service\nThe search service is an implementation of the Stark Generic Search Service.\nIt must contain these functions :\n\nsearch\ngetSearchState\nresetSearchState\ncreateNew\n\nThe search service depends on the type.repository.ts.\n2.5.1. Create the search service\n2.5.1.1. Create the interface\nYou need to create a Search service interface that extends the StarkGenericSearchService interface and pass the type of the data in the extension.\nFirstly the main entity, Movie in this case, and secondly the search entity, MovieSearch still for this case.\nimport { MovieObject, MovieSearchCriteria } from \"../entities\";\nimport { StarkGenericSearchService } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui\";\nimport { InjectionToken } from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { Observable } from \"rxjs\";\n\nexport const movieServiceName: string = \"DemoGenericService\";\nexport const MOVIE_SERVICE: InjectionToken = new InjectionToken(movieServiceName);\n\nexport interface MovieService extends StarkGenericSearchService {\n  getYears(): Observable;\n\n  getMovies(): Observable;\n\n  getHeroes(): Observable;\n}2.5.1.2. Create the implementation\nYou need\nimport { MovieService } from \"./demo-generic.service.intf\";\nimport { Inject, Injectable } from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { Observable, of } from \"rxjs\";\nimport { map } from \"rxjs/operators\";\nimport { StarkSearchState } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui\";\nimport { MovieObject, MovieSearchCriteria } from \"../entities\";\nimport { MovieSearchState, selectMovieSearch } from \"../reducers\";\nimport { MOVIE_REPOSITORY, MovieRepository } from \"../repositories\";\nimport { Store, select } from \"@ngrx/store\";\nimport { MovieSearchActions } from \"../actions\";\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class DemoGenericServiceImpl implements MovieService {\n  public constructor(\n    private store: Store,\n    @Inject(MOVIE_REPOSITORY) private movieRepository: MovieRepository\n  ) {}\n\n  public getSearchState(): Observable> {\n    return this.store.pipe(select(selectMovieSearch));\n  }\n\n  public resetSearchState(): void {\n    this.store.dispatch(MovieSearchActions.removeCriteria());\n    this.store.dispatch(MovieSearchActions.hasSearchedReset());\n  }\n\n  public search(criteria: MovieSearchCriteria): Observable {\n    this.store.dispatch(MovieSearchActions.setCriteria({ criteria }));\n    this.store.dispatch(MovieSearchActions.hasSearched());\n\n    return this.movieRepository.search(criteria);\n  }\n}Then don't forget to declare your service in your module :blush:\n2.6. Create the search component page\nGenerate your search component page in src/app/modules//pages by using ng cli:\nng generate component src/app/modules/my_module/pages/my_component-search-page2.6.1. Define your component\nThe component extends the AbstractStarkSearchComponent and pass the type of the data in the extension.\nFirstly the main entity, Movie in this case, and secondly the search entity, MovieSearch still for this case.\nThis component controller describes the different elements necessary for the Stark Table, as the StarkPaginationConfig and the StarkTableColumnProperties.\nAlso, this component's controller must call the parent function ngOnInit in the ngOnInit function.\nimport { Component, Inject, OnDestroy, OnInit } from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { STARK_LOGGING_SERVICE, StarkLoggingService } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-core\";\nimport { AbstractStarkSearchComponent, StarkPaginationConfig, StarkTableColumnProperties } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui\";\nimport { Movie, MovieSearchCriteria } from \"./entities\";\nimport { MOVIE_SERVICE, MovieService } from \"./services\";\n\n@Component({\n  selector: \"movie-search\",\n  templateUrl: \"./movie-search-page.component.html\"\n})\nexport class MovieSearchPageComponent extends AbstractStarkSearchComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {\n  public columnsProperties: StarkTableColumnProperties[];\n  public searchResults: Movie[];\n  public paginationConfig: StarkPaginationConfig;\n\n  public constructor(@Inject(STARK_LOGGING_SERVICE) logger: StarkLoggingService, @Inject(MOVIE_SERVICE) demoGenericService: MovieService) {\n    super(demoGenericService, logger);\n\n    this.performSearchOnInit = true; // Turn on automatic search (last search criteria)\n    this.preserveLatestResults = true; // Keep a reference to the latest results in the latestResults variable\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Component lifecycle hook\n   */\n  public override ngOnInit(): void {\n    super.ngOnInit();\n\n    this.results$.subscribe((movies: Movie[]) => (this.searchResults = movies));\n\n    this.columnsProperties = [\n      {\n        name: \"hero\",\n        label: \"Hero\",\n        isFilterable: true,\n        isSortable: true\n      },\n      {\n        name: \"title\",\n        label: \"Title\",\n        isFilterable: true,\n        isSortable: true\n      },\n      {\n        name: \"year\",\n        label: \"Year\",\n        isFilterable: true,\n        isSortable: true\n      }\n    ];\n\n    this.paginationConfig = {\n      isExtended: false,\n      itemsPerPage: 10,\n      itemsPerPageOptions: [10, 20, 50],\n      itemsPerPageIsPresent: true,\n      page: 1,\n      pageNavIsPresent: true,\n      pageInputIsPresent: true\n    };\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Component lifecycle hook\n   */\n  public override ngOnDestroy(): void {\n    super.ngOnDestroy();\n  }\n}2.6.2. Define your template\nThe template contains all information necessary for a page, the title and the stark-generic-search component.\nThe usage of Generic Search component is explained in the StarkGenericSearchComponent API documentation.\nMovie Search\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/timeout-warning-configuration.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/timeout-warning-configuration.html","title":"additional-page - Timeout Warning configuration","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSession Timeout Warning configuration\nStark provides a nice feature when it comes to session expiration handling: in case the user's session is about to end due\nto inactivity (the user is idle for some time) and you want to warn him about this, a dialog will be displayed.\nThis is what the SessionTimeoutWarningDialogComponent does and also asks the user if its session should be kept alive.\nThis warning dialog is displayed by an NGRX Effect that triggers when a StarkSessionActionTypes.SESSION_TIMEOUT_COUNTDOWN_START action\nis dispatched (by the Session service when the user becomes idle).\nTo use this feature, you'll have to modify the app.module.ts file of your application\napp.module.ts\nYou'll have to import the StarkSessionUiModule like follow:\nimport {StarkSessionUiModule} from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui\";\n\n@NgModule({\n    imports: [\n        StarkSessionUiModule.forRoot(),\n        ...\n    ]\n})To indicate that you don't wish to display such warning dialog, just set timeoutWarningDialogDisabled value to true.\nThis option is false by default.\nimport {StarkSessionUiModule} from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui\";\n\n@NgModule({\n    imports: [\n        StarkSessionUiModule.forRoot({\n            timeoutWarningDialogDisabled: true\n        }),\n        ...\n    ]\n})\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/testing-subpackage.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/testing-subpackage.html","title":"additional-page - Testing Subpackage","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStark UI Testing subpackage\n\n@nationalbankbelgium/stark-ui/testing\n\nSubpackage of Stark UI that contains the mock classes that come in hand when implementing unit tests that depend on\nany of the main services provided by Stark UI.\nMock Classes\nThe mock classes provided by this subpackage are the following:\n\nMockStarkAppSidebarService\nMockStarkMessagePaneService\nMockStarkProgressIndicatorService\nMockStarkToastNotificationService\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
