styles and the Stark logo to display a basic animation during app initialization. These are provided under the assets folder of the package.\nYou must include those assets in your angular.json so that they are copied to your application assets folder and the initialization animations are displayed correctly:\n\"projects\": {\n    ...\n    \"your-app\": {\n        ...\n        \"architect\": {\n            ...\n            \"build\": {\n                \"options\": {\n                    \"styles\": [\n                        \"node_modules/@nationalbankbelgium/stark-core/assets/css/pre-load-style.css\",\n                        ...\n                    ],\n                }\n                ...\n            },\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n}IMPORTANT: This should be done always. As mentioned above, these are used by Stark-Core internally when the application initializes.\nAssets\nBase assets\nStark-Core provides also some assets that are needed for any Stark based application. Therefore you must include those assets in your angular.json so that they are copied to\nyour application assets folder and the Stark-Core styles are applied correctly:\n\"projects\": {\n    ...\n    \"your-app\": {\n        ...\n        \"architect\": {\n            ...\n            \"build\": {\n                \"options\": {\n                    \"assets\": [\n                        {\n                            \"glob\": \"**/*\",\n                            \"input\": \"node_modules/@nationalbankbelgium/stark-core/assets/\",\n                            \"output\": \"assets/stark-core\"\n                        },\n                        ...\n                    ],\n                    ...\n                }\n            },\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n}IMPORTANT: This should be done always. As mentioned above, these are used by Stark-Core internally when the application initializes. In case you want to copy just certain\nassets from Stark-Core, make sure that you copy them following this structure in your application assets folder:\n|\n+---yourApp\n|   +---assets\n|   |   +---stark-core  // assets from Stark-Core should be available at this location\n|   ...This will ensure that your application assets folder will contain only the assets that are actually used in your app.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/environments-support.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/environments-support.html","title":"additional-page -

NgModule instance created by Angular for a given platform.\n     */\n    decorateModule(moduleRef: NgModuleRef): NgModuleRef;\n}In your project, the files to define the different environments will be located in src/environments:\n|\n+---src\n|   |\n|   +---environments                    # configuration variables for each environment\n|   |   |                               #\n|   |   |   environment.e2e.prod.ts     # e2e tests configuration\n|   |   |   environment.hmr.ts          # development with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) configuration\n|   |   |   environment.prod.ts         # production configuration\n|   |   \\   environment.ts              # development configuration\n|   |\n|   \\   ...\n|\n\\   ...Then in each file, an environment constant of type StarkEnvironment should be exported providing the values needed for each environment:\n// environment.prod.ts\n\nimport { NgModuleRef } from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { StarkEnvironment } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-core\";\n\nexport const environment: StarkEnvironment = {\n    production: true,\n    hmr: false,\n    ENV_PROVIDERS: [ProductionOnlyProvider],\n\n    decorateModule(moduleRef: NgModuleRef): NgModuleRef {\n        // perform any module customization needed for this specific environment here\n        // and make sure to invoke this function by passing it the NgModule created by Angular\n        return moduleRef;\n    }\n};How to get environment variables in your application?\nAll you have to do is to import the environment.ts constant anywhere you want in your application.\nYou should always import from environments/environment because Webpack will internally replace such file with the right environment file as defined in the fileReplacements option in the angular.json file.\nThis way, you will be able to programmatically read the different environment variables you need.\nFor example, you can determine which providers you will include for a specific environment in your AppModule:\nimport { NgModule } from \"@angular/core\";\n// the environment file should always be imported from this path\nimport { environment } from \"environments/environment\";\n\n@NgModule({\n    bootstrap: [AppComponent],\n    declarations: [AppComponent],\n    imports: [...],\n    providers: [\n        environment.ENV_PROVIDERS,\n        ...\n    ]\n})\nexport class AppModule { ... }You can also determine on which environment your app is currently running with this simple check:\n// the environment file should always be imported from this path\nimport { environment } from \"environments/environment\";\n\n// if true, your app is running in production environment\nif (environment.production) {\n    /* the code in this block will be executed only in production */\n}How to add a new environment?\nFirst, create your new environment.ts file in the src/environments folder.\nThen, make sure your new environment implements the StarkEnvironment interface. For example, the environment.dummy-env.ts file:\nimport { NgModuleRef } from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { StarkEnvironment } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-core\";\n\nexport const environment: StarkEnvironment = {\n    production: false / true,\n    hmr: false,\n    ENV_PROVIDERS: [],\n\n    decorateModule(moduleRef: NgModuleRef): NgModuleRef {\n        // perform any module customization needed for this specific environment here\n        // and make sure to invoke this function by passing it the NgModule created by Angular\n        return moduleRef;\n    }\n};Finally, define the file replacement of your new environment in the angular.json file so that Webpack can replace the default file environments/environment with your new file:\n{\n    ...\n    \"dummyEnv\": {\n        \"fileReplacements\": [\n            {\n                \"replace\": \"src/environments/environment.ts\",\n                \"with\": \"src/environments/environment.dummy-env.ts\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}How to add more properties to the environment file?\nIn case you want to add more properties, you should first create your own interface which should extend the StarkEnvironment interface.\nFor example:\nimport { StarkEnvironment } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-core\";\n\nexport interface YourOwnEnvironment extends StarkEnvironment {\n    someProperty: any;\n}Then adapt the different environment files to add the new properties:\nimport { NgModuleRef } from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { StarkEnvironment } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-core\";\n\nexport const environment: StarkEnvironment = {\n    production: false / true,\n    hmr: false,\n    ENV_PROVIDERS: [],\n    someProperty: \"some value\", // your new property\n\n    decorateModule(moduleRef: NgModuleRef): NgModuleRef {\n        // perform any module customization needed for this specific environment here\n        // and make sure to invoke this function by passing it the NgModule created by Angular\n        return moduleRef;\n    }\n};Environment information at compilation time (Webpack global variables)\nThanks to the customizations done by Stark-Build to the default Angular CLI build configuration you have some global variables available at compilation time,\nwhich means that you can implement some checks in your code and this will be analyzed when your application bundle is being built by Webpack.\nSee Stark-Build: Webpack build customizations - DefinePlugin\nWhy do you need the target environment at compilation time?\nSometimes you might need to add some logic or import some files only when your application is running in development or production.\nIn this case, when Webpack builds your application, the final bundle will contain also that code and/or imports that will only be used on a specific environment.\nFor example, the specific code related to development will never be executed in production and yet it will be included in your production build which will increase the size of your bundle.\nThis is why knowing the target environment at compilation time is useful. You can put the logic inside an if block and then such code will be tree-shaken by Webpack as it will recognize it as dead code:\n// this check is translated to \"if (false)\" when ENV is \"production\"\n// allowing Webpack to identify it as dead code and so remove it\nif (ENV === \"development\") {\n    /* the code inside this block will only be included in development */\n}\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/default-error-handling.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/default-error-handling.html","title":"additional-page - Default Error Handling","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStark Default Error Handling\nStark provides its own error handler, StarkErrorHandler, that overrides  Angular's default ErrorHandler.\nThis handler will dispatch a StarkUnhandledError action to the application Store which you can treat as you want.\nStarkErrorHandlingModule\nIf you want to use this handler, you simply have to import StarkErrorHandlingModule from stark-core in your app.module.ts file.\nimport {StarkErrorHandlingModule} from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-core\";\n\n@NgModule({\n    bootstrap: ...\n    declarations: ...\n    imports: [\n        StarkErrorHandlingModule.forRoot(),\n        ...\n        ]\n    })Effects definition\nTo define what to do when an error happens, you can simply create a new effects file, like in the following example:\n...\nimport {StarkErrorHandlingActionTypes, StarkUnhandledError} from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-core\";\n\n/**\n * This class is used to determine what to do with an error\n */\n@Injectable()\nexport class StarkErrorHandlingEffects {\n\n    public constructor(\n        private actions$: Actions\n    ) {}\n\n    @Effect()\n    public doSomething(): Observable {\n        return this.actions$.pipe(\n            ofType(StarkErrorHandlingActionTypes.UNHANDLED_ERROR),\n            map((action: StarkUnhandledError) => {\n                //DO SOMETHING\n            })\n        );\n    }\n}If you do create that file, don't forget to import it in your app.module.ts file:\n...\nimport { StarkErrorHandlingEffects } from \"./shared/effects/stark-error-handler.effects\";\n\n@NgModule({\n    bootstrap: ...\n    declarations: ...\n    imports: [\n        ...\n        EffectsModule.forRoot([StarkErrorHandlingEffects]),\n        ...\n    ]\n})\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
