MockStarkHttpService can be imported as follows:\nimport { MockStarkHttpService } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-core/testing\";Since the mock class implements the base interface of the service it mocks, you just need to provide the mock in your TestingModule:\nTestBed.configureTestingModule({\n    imports: [...],\n    declarations: [...],\n    providers: [\n        ...\n        { provide: STARK_HTTP_SERVICE, useValue: new MockStarkHttpService() },\n        ...\n    ]\n});Then you can just inject the Stark service via the TestBed using its corresponding InjectionToken:\n// this will inject the instantiated mock class\nmockHttpService = TestBed.inject(STARK_HTTP_SERVICE);In fact, every method of the base interface is simply mocked\nwith a Jasmine Spy which can then be used in the unit tests to:\n\nreturn custom values\noverride a method with a custom function\nasserting that they are actually called\ndo any other operation than can be performed with an Spy.\n\nFor example:\n// returning custom value\nmockHttpService.executeSingleItemRequest.and.returnValue(of(someSingleItemResponseWrapper));\n\n// overriding a method with a custom function\nmockHttpService.executeSingleItemRequest.and.callFake((someRequest) => {\n  // some custom logic to return a specific value\n});\n\n// asserting that a method was indeed called\nexpect(mockHttpService.executeSingleItemRequest).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);\nexpect(mockHttpService.executeSingleItemRequest).toHaveBeenCalledWith(someRequest);\n    \n\n    \n        import {

   \n        Usage\nThe mock class MockStarkLoggingService can be imported as follows:\nimport { MockStarkLoggingService } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-core/testing\";Since the mock class implements the base interface of the service it mocks, you just need to provide the mock in your TestingModule:\nTestBed.configureTestingModule({\n    imports: [...],\n    declarations: [...],\n    providers: [\n        ...\n        { provide: STARK_LOGGING_SERVICE, useValue: new MockStarkLoggingService() },\n        ...\n    ]\n});The instantiated mock will have these default properties assigned:\n\ncorrelationId = \"dummyCorrelationId\"\ncorrelationIdHttpHeaderName = \"Correlation-Id-HttpHeaderName\".\n\nIn case you need specific values for any of those properties, then you need to pass a custom correlationId and/or a custom correlationIdHttpHeaderName\nto the constructor of the mock class:\nnew MockStarkLoggingService(\"custom-correlation-id\", \"custom-correlation-id-header\");Then you can just inject the Stark service via the TestBed using its corresponding InjectionToken:\n// this will inject the instantiated mock class\nmockLoggingService = TestBed.inject(STARK_LOGGING_SERVICE);In fact, every method of the base interface is simply mocked\nwith a Jasmine Spy which can then be used in the unit tests to:\n\nreturn custom values\noverride a method with a custom function\nasserting that they are actually called\ndo any other operation than can be performed with an Spy.\n\nFor example:\n// reading a value\nconst correlationId = mockLoggingService.correlationId;\n\n// overriding a method with a custom function\nmockLoggingService.error.and.callFake((someMessage, someError) => {\n  // some custom logic to return a specific value\n});\n\n// asserting that a method was indeed called\nexpect(mockLoggingService.error).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);\nexpect(mockLoggingService.error).toHaveBeenCalledWith(someMessage, someError);\n    \n\n    \n        import { StarkLoggingService }

\n\n    \n        Usage\nThe mock class MockStarkRoutingService can be imported as follows:\nimport { MockStarkRoutingService } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-core/testing\";Since the mock class implements the base interface of the service it mocks, you just need to provide the mock in your TestingModule:\nTestBed.configureTestingModule({\n    imports: [...],\n    declarations: [...],\n    providers: [\n        ...\n        { provide: STARK_ROUTING_SERVICE, useValue: new MockStarkRoutingService() },\n        ...\n    ]\n});Then you can just inject the Stark service via the TestBed using its corresponding InjectionToken:\n// this will inject the instantiated mock class\nmockRoutingService = TestBed.inject(STARK_ROUTING_SERVICE);In fact, every method of the base interface is simply mocked\nwith a Jasmine Spy which can then be used in the unit tests to:\n\nreturn custom values\noverride a method with a custom function\nasserting that they are actually called\ndo any other operation than can be performed with an Spy.\n\nFor example:\n// returning custom value\nmockRoutingService.isCurrentUiState.and.returnValue(false);\n\n// overriding a method with a custom function\nmockRoutingService.isCurrentUiState.and.callFake((someState) => {\n  // some custom logic to return a specific value\n});\n\n// asserting that a method was indeed called\nexpect(mockRoutingService.isCurrentUiState).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);\nexpect(mockRoutingService.isCurrentUiState).toHaveBeenCalledWith(someState, someParams);\n    \n\n    \n        import { StarkRoutingService } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-core\";\nimport Spy = jasmine.Spy;\nimport SpyObj = jasmine.SpyObj;\nimport createSpy = jasmine.createSpy;\n\n/**\n * Mock class of the {@link

follows:\nimport { MockStarkSessionService } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-core/testing\";Since the mock class implements the base interface of the service it mocks, you just need to provide the mock in your TestingModule:\nTestBed.configureTestingModule({\n    imports: [...],\n    declarations: [...],\n    providers: [\n        ...\n        { provide: STARK_SESSION_SERVICE, useValue: new MockStarkSessionService() },\n        ...\n    ]\n});The instantiated mock will have this default property assigned:\n\ndevAuthenticationHeaders = new Map()\n\nIn case you need specific values for those headers, then you need to pass a custom devAuthenticationHeaders\nto the constructor of the mock class:\nconst customAuthenticationHeaders = new Map();\n// add the headers you need to the map\ncustomAuthenticationHeaders.set(someHeaderName, someHeaderValue);\ncustomAuthenticationHeaders.set(anotherHeaderName, anotherHeaderValue);\n// pass the map to the constructor\nnew MockStarkSessionService(customAuthenticationHeaders);Then you can just inject the Stark service via the TestBed using its corresponding InjectionToken:\n// this will inject the instantiated mock class\nmockSessionService = TestBed.inject(STARK_SESSION_SERVICE);In fact, every method of the base interface is simply mocked\nwith a Jasmine Spy which can then be used in the unit tests to:\n\nreturn custom values\noverride a method with a custom function\nasserting that they are actually called\ndo any other operation than can be performed with an Spy.\n\nFor example:\n// reading a value\nconst devAuthenticationHeaders = mockSessionService.devAuthenticationHeaders;\n\n// overriding a method with a custom function\nmockSessionService.getCurrentUser.and.callFake(() => {\n  // some custom logic to return a specific value\n});\n\n// asserting that a method was indeed called\nexpect(mockSessionService.login).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);\nexpect(mockSessionService.login).toHaveBeenCalledWith(someUser);\n    \n\n    \n        import { StarkSessionService } from

the mock class implements the base interface of the service it mocks, you just need to provide the mock in your TestingModule:\nTestBed.configureTestingModule({\n    imports: [...],\n    declarations: [...],\n    providers: [\n        ...\n        { provide: STARK_XSRF_SERVICE, useValue: new MockStarkXsrfService() },\n        ...\n    ]\n});Then you can just inject the Stark service via the TestBed using its corresponding InjectionToken:\n// this will inject the instantiated mock class\nmockXSRFService = TestBed.inject(STARK_XSRF_SERVICE);In fact, every method of the base interface is simply mocked\nwith a Jasmine Spy which can then be used in the unit tests to:\n\nreturn custom values\noverride a method with a custom function\nasserting that they are actually called\ndo any other operation than can be performed with an Spy.\n\nFor example:\n// returning custom value\nmockXSRFService.getXSRFToken.and.returnValue(\"some token\");\n\n// overriding a method with a custom function\nmockXSRFService.getXSRFToken.and.callFake(() => {\n  // some custom logic to return a specific value\n});\n\n// asserting that a method was indeed called\nexpect(mockXSRFService.configureHttpRequest).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);\nexpect(mockXSRFService.configureHttpRequest).toHaveBeenCalledWith(someRequest);\n    \n\n    \n        import {

Stark framework, they are stored in the translations folder in the current folder.\nModule: each module contains it's own translations, to make Stark fully modular.\nApp: the translations provided by the client application that implements the Stark framework.\n\nThese levels have a hierarchy, where the common translations have to lowest priority and the translations\nof the client application have the highest priority. This means that if one or more levels have a\ntranslation with the same key, the translation with the highest priority 'wins'.\nFunctionality:\nFirst the existing translations are stored in a variable translations.\nThe function then iterates over the args parameters.\nFor each language, the following steps are processed:\n\nThe translateService is cleaned (shouldMerge = false)\nThe 'common' translations are added in the translateService\nThe 'module' translations are added in the translateService, replacing any existing translations\nThe 'stored' translations are added in the

basic CSS styles and the Stark logo to display a basic animation during app initialization. These are provided under the assets folder of the package.\nYou must include those assets in your angular.json so that they are copied to your application assets folder and the initialization animations are displayed correctly:\n\"projects\": {\n    ...\n    \"your-app\": {\n        ...\n        \"architect\": {\n            ...\n            \"build\": {\n                \"options\": {\n                    \"styles\": [\n                        \"node_modules/@nationalbankbelgium/stark-core/assets/css/pre-load-style.css\",\n                        ...\n                    ],\n                }\n                ...\n            },\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n}IMPORTANT: This should be done always. As mentioned above, these are used by Stark-Core internally when the application initializes.\nAssets\nBase assets\nStark-Core provides also some assets that are needed for any Stark based application. Therefore you must include those assets in your angular.json so that they are copied to\nyour application assets folder and the Stark-Core styles are applied correctly:\n\"projects\": {\n    ...\n    \"your-app\": {\n        ...\n        \"architect\": {\n            ...\n            \"build\": {\n                \"options\": {\n                    \"assets\": [\n                        {\n                            \"glob\": \"**/*\",\n                            \"input\": \"node_modules/@nationalbankbelgium/stark-core/assets/\",\n                            \"output\": \"assets/stark-core\"\n                        },\n                        ...\n                    ],\n                    ...\n                }\n            },\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n}IMPORTANT: This should be done always. As mentioned above, these are used by Stark-Core internally when the application initializes. In case you want to copy just certain\nassets from Stark-Core, make sure that you copy them following this structure in your application assets folder:\n|\n+---yourApp\n|   +---assets\n|   |   +---stark-core  // assets from Stark-Core should be available at this location\n|   ...This will ensure that your application assets folder will contain only the assets that are actually used in your app.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/environments-support.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/environments-support.html","title":"additional-page -

NgModule instance created by Angular for a given platform.\n   */\n  decorateModule(moduleRef: NgModuleRef): NgModuleRef;\n}In your project, the files to define the different environments will be located in src/environments:\n|\n+---src\n|   |\n|   +---environments                    # configuration variables for each environment\n|   |   |                               #\n|   |   |   environment.e2e.prod.ts     # e2e tests configuration\n|   |   |   environment.hmr.ts          # development with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) configuration\n|   |   |   environment.prod.ts         # production configuration\n|   |   \\   environment.ts              # development configuration\n|   |\n|   \\   ...\n|\n\\   ...Then in each file, an environment constant of type StarkEnvironment should be exported providing the values needed for each environment:\n// environment.prod.ts\n\nimport { NgModuleRef } from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { StarkEnvironment } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-core\";\n\nexport const environment: StarkEnvironment = {\n  production: true,\n  hmr: false,\n  ENV_PROVIDERS: [ProductionOnlyProvider],\n\n  decorateModule(moduleRef: NgModuleRef): NgModuleRef {\n    // perform any module customization needed for this specific environment here\n    // and make sure to invoke this function by passing it the NgModule created by Angular\n    return moduleRef;\n  }\n};How to get environment variables in your application?\nAll you have to do is to import the environment.ts constant anywhere you want in your application.\nYou should always import from environments/environment because Webpack will internally replace such file with the right environment file as defined in the fileReplacements option in the angular.json file.\nThis way, you will be able to programmatically read the different environment variables you need.\nFor example, you can determine which providers you will include for a specific environment in your AppModule:\nimport { NgModule } from \"@angular/core\";\n// the environment file should always be imported from this path\nimport { environment } from \"environments/environment\";\n\n@NgModule({\n    bootstrap: [AppComponent],\n    declarations: [AppComponent],\n    imports: [...],\n    providers: [\n        environment.ENV_PROVIDERS,\n        ...\n    ]\n})\nexport class AppModule { ... }You can also determine on which environment your app is currently running with this simple check:\n// the environment file should always be imported from this path\nimport { environment } from \"environments/environment\";\n\n// if true, your app is running in production environment\nif (environment.production) {\n  /* the code in this block will be executed only in production */\n}How to add a new environment?\nFirst, create your new environment.ts file in the src/environments folder.\nThen, make sure your new environment implements the StarkEnvironment interface. For example, the environment.dummy-env.ts file:\nimport { NgModuleRef } from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { StarkEnvironment } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-core\";\n\nexport const environment: StarkEnvironment = {\n  production: false / true,\n  hmr: false,\n  ENV_PROVIDERS: [],\n\n  decorateModule(moduleRef: NgModuleRef): NgModuleRef {\n    // perform any module customization needed for this specific environment here\n    // and make sure to invoke this function by passing it the NgModule created by Angular\n    return moduleRef;\n  }\n};Finally, define the file replacement of your new environment in the angular.json file so that Webpack can replace the default file environments/environment with your new file:\n{\n    ...\n    \"dummyEnv\": {\n        \"fileReplacements\": [\n            {\n                \"replace\": \"src/environments/environment.ts\",\n                \"with\": \"src/environments/environment.dummy-env.ts\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}How to add more properties to the environment file?\nIn case you want to add more properties, you should first create your own interface which should extend the StarkEnvironment interface.\nFor example:\nimport { StarkEnvironment } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-core\";\n\nexport interface YourOwnEnvironment extends StarkEnvironment {\n  someProperty: any;\n}Then adapt the different environment files to add the new properties:\nimport { NgModuleRef } from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { StarkEnvironment } from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-core\";\n\nexport const environment: StarkEnvironment = {\n  production: false / true,\n  hmr: false,\n  ENV_PROVIDERS: [],\n  someProperty: \"some value\", // your new property\n\n  decorateModule(moduleRef: NgModuleRef): NgModuleRef {\n    // perform any module customization needed for this specific environment here\n    // and make sure to invoke this function by passing it the NgModule created by Angular\n    return moduleRef;\n  }\n};Environment information at compilation time (Webpack global variables)\nThanks to the customizations done by Stark-Build to the default Angular CLI build configuration you have some global variables available at compilation time,\nwhich means that you can implement some checks in your code and this will be analyzed when your application bundle is being built by Webpack.\nSee Stark-Build: Webpack build customizations - DefinePlugin\nWhy do you need the target environment at compilation time?\nSometimes you might need to add some logic or import some files only when your application is running in development or production.\nIn this case, when Webpack builds your application, the final bundle will contain also that code and/or imports that will only be used on a specific environment.\nFor example, the specific code related to development will never be executed in production and yet it will be included in your production build which will increase the size of your bundle.\nThis is why knowing the target environment at compilation time is useful. You can put the logic inside an if block and then such code will be tree-shaken by Webpack as it will recognize it as dead code:\n// this check is translated to \"if (false)\" when ENV is \"production\"\n// allowing Webpack to identify it as dead code and so remove it\nif (ENV === \"development\") {\n  /* the code inside this block will only be included in development */\n}\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/default-error-handling.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/default-error-handling.html","title":"additional-page - Default Error Handling","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStark Default Error Handling\nStark provides its own error handler, StarkErrorHandler, that overrides Angular's default ErrorHandler.\nThis handler will dispatch a StarkUnhandledError action to the application Store which you can treat as you want.\nStarkErrorHandlingModule\nIf you want to use this handler, you simply have to import StarkErrorHandlingModule from stark-core in your app.module.ts file.\nimport {StarkErrorHandlingModule} from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-core\";\n\n@NgModule({\n    bootstrap: ...\n    declarations: ...\n    imports: [\n        StarkErrorHandlingModule.forRoot(),\n        ...\n        ]\n    })Effects definition\nTo define what to do when an error happens, you can simply create a new effects file, like in the following example:\n...\nimport {StarkErrorHandlingActionTypes, StarkUnhandledError} from \"@nationalbankbelgium/stark-core\";\n\n/**\n * This class is used to determine what to do with an error\n */\n@Injectable()\nexport class StarkErrorHandlingEffects {\n\n    public constructor(\n        private actions$: Actions\n    ) {}\n\n    @Effect()\n    public doSomething(): Observable {\n        return this.actions$.pipe(\n            ofType(StarkErrorHandlingActionTypes.UNHANDLED_ERROR),\n            map((action: StarkUnhandledError) => {\n                //DO SOMETHING\n            })\n        );\n    }\n}If you do create that file, don't forget to import it in your app.module.ts file:\n...\nimport { StarkErrorHandlingEffects } from \"./shared/effects/stark-error-handler.effects\";\n\n@NgModule({\n    bootstrap: ...\n    declarations: ...\n    imports: [\n        ...\n        EffectsModule.forRoot([StarkErrorHandlingEffects]),\n        ...\n    ]\n})\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/testing-subpackage.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/testing-subpackage.html","title":"additional-page - Testing Subpackage","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStark Core Testing subpackage\n\n@nationalbankbelgium/stark-core/testing\n\nSubpackage of Stark Core that contains the mock classes that come in hand when implementing unit tests that depend on\nany of the main services provided by Stark Core.\nMock Classes\nThe mock classes provided by this subpackage are the following:\n\nMockStarkHttpService\nMockStarkLoggingService\nMockStarkRoutingService\nMockStarkSessionService\nMockStarkUserService\nMockStarkXsrfService\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
