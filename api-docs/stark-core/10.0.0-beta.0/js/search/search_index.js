existing translations.\nThere are three 'levels' that can provide translations:\n\nCommon: for the Stark framework, they are stored in the 'translations' folder in the current folder.\nModule: each module contains it's own translations, to make Stark fully modular.\nApp: the translations provided by the client application that implements the Stark framework.\n\nThese levels have a hierarchy, where the common translations have to lowest priority and the translations\nof the client application have the highest priority. This means that if one or more levels have a\ntranslation with the same key, the translation with the highest priority 'wins'.\nFunctionality:\nFirst the existing translations are stored in a variable 'translations'.\nThe function then iterates over the 'args' parameters.\nFor each language, the following steps are processed:\n\nThe translateService is cleaned (shouldMerge = false)\nThe 'common' translations are added in the translateService\nThe 'module' translations are added in the translateService, replacing any existing translations\nThe 'stored' translations are added in the translateService, replacing any existing translations\n\n\n\n                            \n                                    Parameters :\n                                    \n
